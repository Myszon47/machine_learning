# machine_learning
Hiii !!

In this project, I compare various machine learning models. The prediction concerns data from Kaggle and assigns a fitness class based on personal data. For this purpose, I used Jupyter Notebook, Python (pandas, sklearn, tensorflow), and the models I compare include regression, Bayesian, KNN, decision trees, and neural networks.
